Our design team stays updated on green packaging innovations – from compostable bioplastics to new recyclable pump mechanisms – and we continuously expand our offerings accordingly." },

          { title: "Normes mondiales & certifications", desc: "Nous veillons à ce que tous nos matériaux et produits respectent les réglementations en vigueur sur nos marchés cibles. Cela inclut les normes européennes (telles que REACH et le nouveau Règlement sur les emballages et les déchets d’emballages (PPWR)), les exigences de la FDA américaine, ainsi que les règles spécifiques aux autres régions que nous desservons." },
          { title: "Prêts pour le PPWR", desc: "Le nouveau règlement européen PPWR impose des changements majeurs – par exemple, tous les emballages devront être recyclables d’ici 2030, et un pourcentage minimum de matière recyclée sera obligatoire dans les plastiques. Elmvale Global conçoit d’ores et déjà des emballages pour satisfaire à ces critères. Nous privilégions les conceptions monomatériaux et l’utilisation de résines PCR (Post-Consumer Recycled), de sorte que les emballages de votre marque soient dès à présent en phase avec les lois à venir. Notre équipe peut vous conseiller sur l’ajustement de votre gamme d’emballages afin de respecter les objectifs de réduction des déchets (par exemple, éliminer l’espace ou le poids superflus, conformément aux principes du « packaging sensé »)." },
          { title: "Contrôle qualité & tests", desc: "Chaque lot d’emballages fait l’objet de contrôles qualité. Nous fournissons des certificats de conformité et pouvons faciliter des tests par des laboratoires tiers. Nos partenaires fabricants sont certifiés ISO 9001 pour la gestion de la qualité, et beaucoup disposent de la certification ISO 14001 (management environnemental), reflétant leur engagement en faveur de pratiques durables." },
          { title: "Documentation & transparence", desc: "Nous tenons à jour une documentation complète pour nos produits – fiches techniques des matériaux, traçabilité des lots et certificats de conformité réglementaire sont mis à disposition de nos clients. Cette transparence vous assure de disposer de tous les documents nécessaires pour vos propres obligations de conformité, et vous apporte une tranquillité d’esprit lors d’audits ou de questions de vos clients. (Par exemple, nous pouvons fournir sur demande les déclarations de conformité UE pour vos emballages, comme exigé par la réglementation européenne.)" }

          { title: "Philosophie d’éco-conception", desc: "La durabilité est intégrée dans la conception de nos produits. Nous appliquons la philosophie « réduire, réutiliser, recycler » à chaque étape. Cela signifie réduire l’utilisation de matériaux (par ex. : éliminer les emballages secondaires superflus ou adopter des designs allégés), encourager la réutilisation lorsque c’est possible (emballages durables que les consommateurs peuvent recharger ou détourner) et garantir la recyclabilité. Notre équipe de design se tient informée des dernières innovations en packaging écologique – des bioplastiques compostables aux nouveaux mécanismes de pompe recyclables – et enrichit en continu notre offre en ce sens." },
          { title: "Matériaux & contenu recyclé", desc: "Nous offrons des matériaux à la fois de haute qualité et respectueux de l’environnement. Beaucoup de nos composants plastiques peuvent être fabriqués avec des plastiques PCR (résine recyclée post-consommation) à divers taux d’inclusion (10 %, 30 %, 50 % et plus), ce qui réduit le besoin de plastique vierge et soutient les filières de recyclage. Nous explorons également les plastiques biosourcés (fabriqués à partir de ressources renouvelables) et d’autres matériaux innovants comme la glassine ou le bambou pour certains besoins d’emballage." },
          { title: "Certifications & initiatives", desc: "Elmvale Global soutient et peut fournir des matériaux durables certifiés – par exemple, des emballages papier certifiés FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) pour une gestion forestière responsable, ou des bioplastiques certifiés OK Compost pour une compostabilité industrielle. Nous nous alignons sur des initiatives mondiales telles que les principes de la New Plastics Economy de la Fondation Ellen MacArthur, avec pour objectif à terme de proposer des emballages 100 % réutilisables, recyclables ou compostables." },

En optimisant notre chaîne d’approvisionnement et en regroupant les expéditions, nous contribuons à réduire les émissions liées au transport. Nous offrons également la possibilité d’explorer des options d’expédition neutres en carbone pour nos clients, ou la mise en place de stocks locaux dans des régions clés (UE/USA) afin de raccourcir les distances de livraison. En interne, nous travaillons avec des partenaires de fabrication qui mettent en œuvre des procédés économes en énergie et des programmes de réduction des déchets dans leurs usines." },*/

Nous fournissons les données liées au développement durable dont vous avez besoin pour votre marketing ou vos rapports ESG (telles que des analyses de cycle de vie, des attestations de contenu recyclé, etc.), ajoutant de la valeur à l’histoire responsable de votre marque." }
